🐉𝓢𝓸𝓶𝓮 𝓯𝓪𝓬𝓽𝓼 𝓪𝓫𝓸𝓾𝓽 𝓶𝓮🐉:

 ☆  My favorite color is #5a86ad

 ☆  When I mention my favorite color I say its hex code (couldn't guess that, huh?)

 ☆  If I could be an animal that isn't human (yes, humans are animals), I'd be the legend from the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, a Phoenix.

𝓡𝓪𝓷𝓭𝓸𝓶:
☆  "I said I would never fall in love again until I found 𝒽𝑒𝓇"
